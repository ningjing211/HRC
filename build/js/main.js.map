It is\n * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n * your questions.\n *\n * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n *\n * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n *\n *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n *\n * So what to do?  The is the best:\n *\n *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n *\n * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n *\n *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n *\n * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n * linear speed or acceleration.\n *\n * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n *\n *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n *\n *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n *     pixels!\n *\n *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n *\n * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n *\n *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n *\n *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n *\n *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n *     you know.\n *\n * Implementation info:\n *\n * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n * average mouse:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *\n * On the trackpad:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *\n * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n * also missing delta values.\n *\n * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n *\n * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n *\n * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n * better normalize spin speed.  Example of what the browsers provide:\n *\n *                          | event.wheelDelta | event.detail\n *        ------------------+------------------+--------------\n *          Safari v5/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n *          Safari v5/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n *         Chrome v17/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n *         Chrome v17/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n *                IE9/Win7  |       -120       |   undefined\n *         Firefox v4/OS X  |     undefined    |       1\n *         Firefox v4/Win7  |     undefined    |       3\n *\n */\nfunction normalizeWheel(/*object*/ event) /*object*/ {\n\tvar sX = 0, sY = 0,       // spinX, spinY\n\t\tpX = 0, pY = 0;       // pixelX, pixelY\n\n\t// Legacy\n\tif ('detail'      in event) { sY = event.detail; }\n\tif ('wheelDelta'  in event) { sY = -event.wheelDelta / 120; }\n\tif ('wheelDeltaY' in event) { sY = -event.wheelDeltaY / 120; }\n\tif ('wheelDeltaX' in event) { sX = -event.wheelDeltaX / 120; }\n\n\t// side scrolling on FF with DOMMouseScroll\n\tif ( 'axis' in event && event.axis === event.HORIZONTAL_AXIS ) {\n\t\tsX = sY;\n\t\tsY = 0;\n\t}\n\n\tpX = sX * PIXEL_STEP;\n\tpY = sY * PIXEL_STEP;\n\n\tif ('deltaY' in event) { pY = event.deltaY; }\n\tif ('deltaX' in event) { pX = event.deltaX; }\n\n\tif ((pX || pY) && event.deltaMode) {\n\t\tif (event.deltaMode == 1) {          // delta in LINE units\n\t\t\tpX *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n\t\t\tpY *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n\t\t} else {                             // delta in PAGE units\n\t\t\tpX *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n\t\t\tpY *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Fall-back if spin cannot be determined\n\tif (pX && !sX) { sX = (pX < 1) ? -1 : 1; }\n\tif (pY && !sY) { sY = (pY < 1) ? -1 : 1; }\n\n\treturn { spinX  : sX,\n\t\tspinY  : sY,\n\t\tpixelX : pX,\n\t\tpixelY : pY };\n}\n\n/**\n * The best combination if you prefer spinX + spinY normalization.

Since a regular \"click\" event will most likely be generated anyway (one that has its isTrusted flag set to true), we must slightly delay our script-generated click so that the \"real\"/trusted one is prioritized. Remember, when there are duplicate events in quick succession, we suppress all but the first one. Some browsers don't even trigger the \"real\" one at all, so our synthetic one is a safety valve that ensures that no matter what, a click event does get dispatched.\n            if (clickTime !== clickDispatch && self.enabled() && !self.isPressed && !originalEvent.defaultPrevented) {\n              if (eventTarget.click) {\n                //some browsers (like mobile Safari) don't properly trigger the click event\n                eventTarget.click();\n              } else if (ownerDoc.createEvent) {\n                syntheticEvent = ownerDoc.createEvent(\"MouseEvents\");\n                syntheticEvent.initMouseEvent(\"click\", true, true, _win, 1, self.pointerEvent.screenX, self.pointerEvent.screenY, self.pointerX, self.pointerY, false, false, false, false, 0, null);\n                eventTarget.dispatchEvent(syntheticEvent);\n              }\n            }\n          };\n\n          if (!_isAndroid && !originalEvent.defaultPrevented) {\n            //iOS Safari requires the synthetic click to happen immediately or else it simply won't work, but Android doesn't play nice.\n            gsap.delayedCall(0.05, syntheticClick); //in addition to the iOS bug workaround, there's a Firefox issue with clicking on things like a video to play, so we must fake a click event in a slightly delayed fashion. Previously, we listened for the \"click\" event with \"capture\" false which solved the video-click-to-play issue, but it would allow the \"click\" event to be dispatched twice like if you were using a jQuery.click() because that was handled in the capture phase, thus we had to switch to the capture phase to avoid the double-dispatching, but do the delayed synthetic click.
